## 📍 Overview

The Learning-and-Experimenting_Data-Science repository functions as a comprehensive learning resource for Data Science, where Machine Learning concepts are beautifully demystified. Primarily geared towards self-learners, it hosts a wide array of solved Machine Learning projects explained along with deep dives into Keras-based deep learning tasks. This repository is a valuable go-to for those aspiring to gain practical, hands-on knowledge in data science and machine learning.
Data science is the field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data.<br> Then, what is Data ? <br>
*Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or just descriptions of things.* <br><br>
This repository contains beginner level topics of Machine Learning and Data Science, as well as some advanced topics. It also contain some great projects which I learn. It takes almost four moths to learn all of the basic things for me. This repository is very close to my heart🖤. I have learnt most of the things from [Codebasics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh9nVJoWXmFb7sLApWGcLPQ) and some of them from different sources. Hats off to the man of this youtube channel for making this possible. He is awesome teacher! One of the interesting part of his lesson is, he gave exercises for every topic. Please, visit his youtube channel and appreciate his hard work. Note that, I am updating this repository on a regular basis. I highly recommened your contribution and obviously feedback.

## 📦 Features

|    | Feature            | Description                                                                                                        |
|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**   | The codebase is organized in folders according to topic (e.g., Deep Learning, Feature Engineering, Data Preprocessing).|
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**   | Uses popular data science libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | The project uses Jupyter notebooks for the majority of work, with a clear segregation of different concepts in different notebooks.|
| 🧪 | **Testing**        | No testing framework or testing strategies were identified in the repository, seems rudimentary for self-learning and understanding concepts.|
| ⚡️  | **Performance**    | Performance evaluation is not explicitly done but common data science libraries are used which are optimized for such tasks.|
| 🔐 | **Security**       | No explicitly defined security measures are found in the project. Data Science-oriented repo, major security concerns not applicable.|
| 🔀 | **Version Control**| The repository uses Git for version control, but no branch management or other advanced strategies seem to be in place.|
| 🔌 | **Integrations**   | Direct integrations with other systems or services are not evidenced in the repository. It primarily deals with locally stored data.|
| 📶 | **Scalability**    | As the project is more about learning data science concepts, scalability in the traditional software sense might not apply here.|

Regression/Multiple_Linear_Regression.py) | This is a multiple linear regression script in Python. It starts by importing required libraries and the data from a CSV file. Then, it encodes categorical features and splits the data into training and testing sets. The script fits the training data into a linear regression model and makes predictions for the test set. Finally, it applies backward elimination to optimize the model by removing statistically insignificant predictors, re-fitting the model each time, and cross-validating the results.                                  |

১| ভবিষ্যতে নিজে কোথাও আটকে গেলে যেন এখান থেকে সাহায্য নিতে পারি।<br>
২| আমি ওপেন সোর্স কমিউনিটি থেকে শিখতেছি। এই কমিউনিটিতে যতটা সম্ভব কন্ট্রিবিউশন করা।<br>
